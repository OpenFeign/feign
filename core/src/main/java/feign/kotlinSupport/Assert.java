/**
 * Assertion utility class that assists in validating arguments.
 *
 * <p>Useful for identifying programmer errors early and clearly at runtime.
 *
 * <p>For example, if the contract of a public method states it does not
 * allow {@code null} arguments, {@code Assert} can be used to validate that
 * contract. Doing this clearly indicates a contract violation when it
 * occurs and protects the class's invariants.
 *
 * <p>Typically used to validate method arguments rather than configuration
 * properties, to check for cases that are usually programmer errors rather
 * than configuration errors. In contrast to configuration initialization
 * code, there is usually no point in falling back to defaults in such methods.
 *
 * <p>This class is similar to JUnit's assertion library. If an argument value is
 * deemed invalid, an {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown (typically).
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * Assert.notNull(clazz, "The class must not be null");
 * Assert.isTrue(i &gt; 0, "The value must be greater than zero");</pre>
 *
 * <p>Mainly for internal use within the framework; for a more comprehensive suite
 * of assertion utilities consider {@code org.apache.commons.lang3.Validate} from
 * <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/">Apache Commons Lang</a>,
 * Google Guava's
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained">Preconditions</a>,
 * or similar third-party libraries.

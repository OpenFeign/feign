/**
 * {@link DeclarativeContract} extension that allows user provided custom encoders to define the
 * request message payload using only the request template and the method parameters, not requiring
 * a specific and unique body object.
 *
 * This type of contract is useful when an application needs a Feign client whose request payload is
 * defined entirely by a custom Feign encoder regardless of how many parameters are declared at the
 * client method. In this case, even with no presence of body parameter the provided encoder will
 * have to know how to define the request payload (for example, based on the method name, method
 * return type, and other metadata provided by custom annotations, all available via the provided
 * {@link RequestTemplate} object).
